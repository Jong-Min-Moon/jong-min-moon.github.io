My name is Jiyoung Park. I am a 3rd year Statistics PhD Student in Texas A&M University. My advisor is [Dr. Anirban Bhattacharya](https://sites.google.com/view/anirban-bhattacharya-tamu/). I am also working with [Dr. Jonathan W. Siegel](https://jwsiegel2510.github.io/) and have worked with [Dr. Stephan Wojtowytsch](https://www.swojtowytsch.com/) in Math department as well. Currently I am exploring fields of (but not limited to) Optimal Transports, Optimization Theory, Learning Theory, and Approximation Theory. 

I did my undergrad in Seoul National University. I majored Economics and Statistics (Double Major), and minored in Computer Science and Engineering. After finishing the undergrad and before entering the PhD, I worked as a Research Resident in [KC-ML2](https://www.kc-ml2.com/), where I did research in Graph Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning supervised by [Dr. Chan Y. Park](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chan-youn-park/).
