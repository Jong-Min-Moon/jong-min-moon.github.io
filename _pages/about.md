My name is Jiyoung Park. I am a 2nd year Statistics PhD Student in Texas A&M University. My advisor is [Dr. Anirban Bhattacharya](https://sites.google.com/view/anirban-bhattacharya-tamu/), and I am also working with [Dr. Stephan Wojtowytsch](https://www.swojtowytsch.com/) in Math department. My research interest lies on geometric approaches to Statistics and Machine Learning. Specific topics includes Wasserstein Geometry, Optimization Theory, Asymptotic Statistics, and their applications to Bayesian Algorithms and Machine Learning.

I did my undergrad in Seoul National University. I majored Economics and Statistics (Double Major), and minored in Computer Science and Engineering.
