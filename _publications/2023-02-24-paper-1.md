This paper deals with Asymptotics of Shallow Neural Network Function. Especially, we deals with how Neural Network functions interpolate the data when data has some incomplete region. Rademacher's Complexity of Neural Network function space and the notion of Gamma Convergence are key ingredients here. Further details will be added once the work gets published.
