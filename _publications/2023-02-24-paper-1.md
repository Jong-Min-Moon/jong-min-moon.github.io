(More formal abstract will be available once the work is completed.)

We analyze how shallow neural networks interpolate between known data points in the infinite data and infinite parameter regime when subject to a weight decay regularizer. Our findings demonstrate that taking an appropriate weight decay regularizer allows the Shallow Neural Network to fit the data and interpolate the incomplete regions through the use of the minimal norm function. We establish the order of the weight decay regularizer required to achieve this minimal norm interpolant. Rademacherâ€™s complexity of Shallow Neural Network function space and the notion of Gamma Convergence are the key ingredients to verify this phenomenon.
