In this paper, we deals with how Shallow Neural Network functions fit the true function, and interpolate the data when data has some incomplete region. Rademacher's Complexity of Shallow Neural Network function space (or more precisely a Barron Space) is the key ingredient to understand how our Neural Network fitting works. For the interpolation behavior, The notion of Gamma Convergence plays a role. More formal abstract will be available once the work is completed.
